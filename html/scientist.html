	<title>Letter to a fellow scientist</title>

<p>Dear conference organizer,</p>

<p>I must regrettfully inform you of my decision to not attend your
distinguished  conference. I appreciate all your efforts to establish a
plattform for scientific exchange. But as I scientist I must recognize the
findings of the climate research community which clearly show a worsening of the
climate. It is therefore of utmost importance that we act in consideration of
the climate of the not so distant future.</p>

<p>
I cannot allow myself to negatively contribute to climate change for the sake of
spending just a few days at the conference. It has been a luxury so far to
travel the world and to see fellow scientists from different labs and I will
miss these opportunities.  But we must find new ways to communicate effectively
over long distances! There might even be more opportunities for better
scientific exchange in the future if we can harness technology to our advantage.
</p>

<p>
I sincerly hope that your conference will be a success but I also hope that more
scientists will recognize the need to find alternative ways of scientific
exchange, because we scientists are on the forefront of the climate crisis.
</p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>
